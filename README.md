# PlayerStats v1.0
This project was coded in BungeeCord 1.13.

This plugin keeps track of basic player information, such as the day the joined the server, the date they were last seen on 
the server, and the total amount of time they've spent on the server. Everything is customizable within the config.yml. You 
can change how, both the data and time are represented. 

All player statistics can be viewed with the command /stats <PlayerName> and to execute this command you will need access to
the permission, playerstats.view.

**This plugin requires a SQL database to store all the information.**
